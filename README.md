# perf-book

This is a repository with source files of the book "Performance Analysis and Tuning on Modern CPU" by Denis Bakhvalov, et al.

**Second edition work in progress!** Planned changes are outlined in the google [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tr2qRDe72VSBYypIANYjJLM_zCdPB6S9m4LmXsQb0vQ/edit?usp=sharing). The planned new table of contents is in [new_toc.md](new_toc.md).

My goal is to accumulate as much knowledge as possible from all the best experts in the industry. And of course, share that knowledge with you. Contributions are welcome.

# Building a book (pdf)

At the moment, building a PDF only works on Windows and Linux. MacOS requires building some components (e.g. pandoc-crossref from sources).

Requirements:

 * Python3. Install natsort module: `pip install natsort`.
 * [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html). Install [version 2.9](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.9.2.1)
 * `pandoc-fignos` and `pandoc-tablenos`. Run `pip install pandoc-fignos pandoc-tablenos`.
 * `pandoc-crossref`. This one requires manual installation. I just downloaded the binary from [here](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref/releases/tag/v0.3.6.4) and copied it to the same place where `pandoc-fignos` is.
 * [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download). Check `Yes` for automatic package installation.

Run:
```bash
# Linux bash and Windows cmd prompt
python export_book.py && pdflatex book.tex && bibtex book && pdflatex book.tex && pdflatex book.tex

# Windows powershell
function Run-Block-With-Error($block) {
    $ErrorActionPreference="Stop"
    Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock $block
}
Run-Block-With-Error {python.exe export_book.py; pdflatex book.tex; bibtex book; pdflatex book.tex; pdflatex book.tex}
```

As a result, `book.pdf` will be generated. The first compilation may be slow.
