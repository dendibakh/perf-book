## Compiler Intrinsics {#sec:secIntrinsics}

There are types of applications that have hotspots worth tuning heavily. However, compilers do not always do what we want in terms of generated code in those hot places. Sometimes human experts can come up with code that outperforms the one generated by the compiler. It usually involves some tricky or specialized algorithms, that can be very hard or even impossible for compiler to figure out. In such cases, there could be no way to make the compiler generate the desired assembly code using standard constructs of the C and C++ languages.

When it is absolutely necessary to generate specific assembly instructions, you should not rely on compiler autovectorization. In such cases, code can instead be written using *compiler intrinsics*. In most cases, compiler intrinsics provide a 1-to-1 mapping to assembly instructions. An example in [@lst:Intrinsics] shows how the C++ version of the horizontal sum of elements in an array (see [@lst:VectIllegal]) can be coded with compiler intrinsics.

Listing: Summing elements of an array with compiler Intrinsics.
		
~~~~ {#lst:Intrinsics .cpp .numberLines}
#include <immintrin.h>

float calcSum(float* a, unsigned N) {  
  __m128 sum = _mm_setzero_ps();      // init sum with zeros
  unsigned i = 0;
  for (; i + 3 < N; i += 4) {
    __m128 vec = _mm_loadu_ps(a + i); // load 4 floats from array
    sum = _mm_add_ps(sum, vec);       // accumulate vec into sum
  }

  // Horizontal sum of the 128-bit vector
  __m128 shuf = _mm_movehdup_ps(sum); // broadcast elements 3,1 to 2,0
  sum = _mm_add_ps(sum, shuf);        // partial sums [0+1] and [2+3]
  shuf = _mm_movehl_ps(shuf, sum);    // high half -> low half
  sum = _mm_add_ss(sum, shuf);        // result in the lower element
  float result = _mm_cvtss_f32(sum);  // nop (compiler eliminates it)

  // Process any remaining elements
  for (; i < N; i++)
      result += a[i];
  return result;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When compiling [@lst:VectIllegal] for the SSE target, compilers would generate mostly identical assembly code as for [@lst:Intrinsics]. I show this example just for illustration purposes. Obviously, there is no need to use intrinsics if the compiler can generate the same machine code. You should use intrinsics only when compiler fails to generate the desired code. 

When you leverage compiler auto-vectorization, it will insert all necessary runtime checks. For instance, it will ensure that there are enough elements to feed the vector execution units (see [@lst:Intrinsics], line 6). Also, the compiler will generate a scalar version of the loop to process the remainder (line 19). When you use intrinsics, you have to take care of safety aspects yourself.

Intrinsics are somewhat easier to use than inline assembly because the compiler performs type checking, takes care of register allocation, and makes further optimizations, e.g., peephole transformations and instruction scheduling. However, they are still often verbose and difficult to read.

When you write code using non-portable platform-specific intrinsics, you should also provide a fallback option for other architectures. A list of all available intrinsics for the Intel platform can be found in this [reference](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/)[^11]. For ARM, you can find such a list here: [https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets/intrinsics/](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets/intrinsics/).

### Wrapper Libraries for Intrinsics {#sec:secIntrinsicLibraries}

For a middle path between low-effort but unpredictable autovectorization, and verbose/unreadable but predictable intrinsics, you can use a wrapper library around intrinsics. These libraries tend to be more readable, provide portability and still give developers control over the generated code. Many such libraries exist, differing in their coverage of recent or "exotic" operations, and the number of platforms they support.

The write-once, target-many model of ISPC is appealing. However, you may wish for tighter integration into C++ programs. For example, interoperability with templates, or avoiding a separate build step and using the same compiler. Conversely, intrinsics offer more control, but at a higher development cost.

Wrapper libraries combine the advantages and avoid drawbacks of both using a so-called embedded domain-specific language, where the vector operations are expressed as normal C++ functions. You can think of these functions as 'portable intrinsics'. Even compiling your code multiple times, once per instruction set, can be done within a normal C++ library by using the preprocessor to 'repeat' your code with different compiler settings, but within unique namespaces. One example of such library is Highway,[^12] which only requires the C++11 standard.

The Highway version of summing elements of an array is presented in [@lst:HWY_code]. The `ScalableTag<float> d` is a type descriptor that represents a "scalable" type, meaning that it can adjust to the available vector width on the target hardware (e.g., AVX2 or NEON). `Zero(d)` initializes `sum` to a vector filled with zeros. This variable will store the accumulated sum as the function iterates through the `array`. The for loop processes `Lanes(d)` elements at a time, where `Lanes(d)` represents the number of floats that can be loaded into a single SIMD vector. The `LoadU` operation loads `Lanes(d)` consecutive elements from `array`. The `Add` operation performs an element-wise addition of the loaded values with the current `sum`, accumulating the result in `sum`.

Listing: Highway version of summing elements of an array.

~~~~ {#lst:HWY_code .cpp}
#include <hwy/highway.h>

float calcSum(const float* HWY_RESTRICT array, size_t count) {
  const ScalableTag<float> d;  // type descriptor; no actual data
  auto sum = Zero(d);
  size_t i = 0;
  for (; i + Lanes(d) <= count; i += Lanes(d)) {
    sum = Add(sum, LoadU(d, array + i));
  }
  sum = Add(sum, MaskedLoad(FirstN(d, count - i), d, array + i));
  return ReduceSum(d, sum);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notice the explicit handling of remainders after the loop processes multiples of the vector size `Lanes(d)`. Although this is more verbose, it makes visible what is actually happening, and allows optimizations such as overlapping the last vector instead of relying on `MaskedLoad`, or even skipping the remainder entirely when the `count` is known to be a multiple of the vector size. Finally, the `ReduceSum` operation reduces all elements in the vector `sum` to a single scalar value by adding them together.

Like ISPC, Highway also supports detecting the best available instruction sets, grouped into 'clusters' which on x86 correspond to Intel Core (S-SSE3), Nehalem (SSE4.2), Haswell (AVX2), Skylake (AVX-512), or Icelake/Zen4 (AVX-512 with extensions). It then calls your code from the corresponding namespace. Unlike intrinsics, the code remains readable (without prefixes/suffixes on each function) and portable.

When you use intrinsics or a wrapper library, it is still advisable to write the initial implementation using C++. This allows rapid prototyping and verification of correctness, by comparing the results of the original code against the new vectorized implementation.

Highway supports over 200 operations, which can be grouped into the following categories:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item Initialization
\item Getting/setting lanes
\item Getting/setting blocks
\item Printing
\item Tuples
\item Arithmetic
\item Logical
\item Masks
\item Comparisons
\item Memory
\item Cache control
\item Type conversion
\item Combine
\item Swizzle/permute
\item Swizzling within 128-bit blocks
\item Reductions
\item Crypto
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

For the full list of operations, see its documentation.[^13] Highway is not the only library of this kind. Other libraries include nsimd, SIMDe, VCL, and xsimd. Note that a C++ standardization effort starting with the Vc library resulted in std::experimental::simd, however, it provides a very limited set of operations and as of this writing is not supported on all the major compilers.
