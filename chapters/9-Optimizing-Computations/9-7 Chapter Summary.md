## Chapter Summary {.unlisted .unnumbered}

* Inefficient computations represent a significant portion of the bottlenecks in real-world applications. Modern compilers are very good at removing unnecessary computation overhead by performing many different code transformations. Still, there is a high chance that we can do better than what compilers can offer.
* In [@sec:CoreBound], we showed how one could search performance headrooms in a program by forcing certain code optimizations. We discussed such popular transformations as function inlining, loop optimizations, and vectorization.
