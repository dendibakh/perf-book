\markright{Epilog}

Thanks for reading through the whole book. I hope you enjoyed it and found it useful. I would be even happier if the book will help you solve a real-world problem. In such a case, I would consider it a success and proof that my efforts were not wasted. Before you continue with your endeavors, let me briefly highlight the essential points of the book and give you final recommendations:

* HW performance is not increasing as rapidly as it used to a few decades ago. Performance tuning is becoming more critical than it has been for the last 40 years. It will be one of the key drivers for performance gains in the near future. 
* Software doesn't have an optimal performance by default. Certain limitations exist that prevent applications to reach their full performance potential. Both HW and SW components have such limitations.
* There is a famous quote by Donald Knuth: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil". But the opposite is often true as well. Postponed performance engineering work may be too late and cause as much evil as premature optimization. Do not neglect performance aspects when designing your future product.
* Performance of modern CPUs is not deterministic and depends on many factors. Meaningful performance analysis should account for noise and use statistical methods to analyze performance measurements.
* Knowledge of the CPU microarchitecture might become handy in understanding the results of experiments you conduct. However, don't rely on this knowledge too much when you make a specific change in your code. Your mental model can never be as accurate as the actual design of the CPU internals. Predicting the performance of a particular piece of code is nearly impossible. *Always measure!*
* Performance is hard because there are no predetermined steps you should follow, no algorithm. Engineers need to tackle problems from different angles. Know performance analysis methods and tools (both HW and SW) that are available to you. I strongly suggest embracing the Roofline model and TMA methodology if they are available on your platform. It will help you to steer your work in the right direction. Also, know when you can leverage other HW performance monitoring features like LBR, PEBS, and PT in your work.
* Understand the limiting factor for the performance of your application and possible ways to fix that. Part 2 covers some of the essential optimizations for every type of CPU performance bottleneck: Front End Bound, Back End Bound, Retiring, Bad Speculation. Use chapters 8-11 to see what options are available when your application falls into one of the four categories mentioned above.
* If the benefit of the modification is negligible, you should keep the code in its most simple and clean form.
* Sometimes modifications that improve performance on one system slow down execution on another system. Make sure you test your changes on all the platforms that you care about.

[TODO]: Performance metrics: be careful about drawing conclusions just by looking at the aggregate numbers. Don't fall in the trap of "excel performance engineering", i.e., only collect performance metrics and never look at the code. Always seek for a second source of data (e.g., performance profiles, discussed later) that will confirm your hypothesis.

I hope this book will help you better understand your application's performance and CPU performance in general. Of course, it doesn't cover every possible scenario you may encounter while working on performance optimization. My goal was to give you a starting point and to show you potential options and strategies for dealing with performance analysis and tuning on modern CPUs.
