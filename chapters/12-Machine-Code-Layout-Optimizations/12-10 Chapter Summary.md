\personal{I think code layout improvements are often underestimated and end up being omitted and forgotten. I agree that you might want to start with low hanging fruits like loop unrolling and vectorization opportunities. But knowing that you might get an extra 5-10\% just from better laying out the machine code is still useful. It is usually the best option to use PGO if you can come up with a set of typical use cases for your application.}
