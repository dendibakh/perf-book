## Exploiting Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP)

Most instructions in a program lend themselves to be pipelined and executed in parallel, as they are independent. Modern CPUs implement a large menu of additional hardware features to exploit such instruction-level parallelism (ILP). Working in concert with advanced compiler techniques, these hardware features provide significant performance improvements. 

### Out-Of-Order (OOO) Execution

The pipeline example in Figure @fig:Pipelining shows all instructions moving through the different stages of the pipeline in-order, i.e., in the same order as they appear in the program. Most modern CPUs support out-of-order (OOO) execution, i.e., sequential instructions can enter the execution pipeline stage in any arbitrary order only limited by their dependencies. OOO execution CPUs must still give the same result as if all instructions were executed in the program order. An instruction is called *retired* when it is finally executed, and its results are correct and visible in the [architectural state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_state). To ensure correctness, CPUs must retire all instructions in the program order. OOO execution is primarily used to avoid underutilization of CPU resources due to stalls caused by dependencies, especially in superscalar engines described in the next section. 

Scheduling of these instructions can be done statically or dynamically. An example of static scheduling is the Intel Itanium. Architectures such as the Intel Itanium moved the burden of scheduling a superscalar, multi-execution unit machine from the hardware to the compiler using a technique known as VLIW - Very Long Instruction Word. The rationale is to simplify the hardware by requiring the compiler to choose the right mix of instructions to keep the machine fully utilized. Compilers can use techniques such as software pipelining and loop unrolling to look farther ahead than can be reasonably supported by hardware structures to find the right ILP. 

The Intel Itanium never managed to become a success:
- The IA-64 is not backwards compatible with IA-32 (X86) code. The 64 bit extension of the X86, X86_64 was introduced in the same time window by AMD and was compatible with IA-32.
- very difficult to schedule the instructions in such a way to keep the CPU busy due to variable load latencies.

That is why modern scheduling is done dynamically. 2 Important algorithms for dynamic scheduling algorithms are [Scoreboading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoreboarding),[^4] and the [Tomasulo algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasulo_algorithm),[^5]  algorithm. The main drawback of score boarding is that it will not only preserve true dependencies (RAW), but also false dependencies (WAW and WAR); and therefor provides suboptimal ILP.

That is why all modern processors have adopted the Tomasulo algoritm for dynamic scheduling. Tomasolu was invented in 1960s and first implemented in the IBM360 model 91. 

The Tomasulo algorithm contains a buffer for instructions called the reorder buffer (ROB) [todo: not part of the original algorithm and is also explain in the speculative section] Instructions are issued to the reorder buffer in program order, they can execute out of order, but will retire in order and therefor the architectural effects of an instruction will become visible in order. Instructions from the reorder buffer are placed in reservation stations where they will wait for the input operands to become ready. Once the input operands are ready, the instructions can be dispatched to the appropriate execution unit.

To help the scheduler find more parallelism within the instruction stream, Tomasulo makes use of a technique called register renaming. This takes place when instructions are placed in the reorder buffer. Register renaming will only preserve true dependencies (RAW) by mapping the very limited number of architectural registers (somewhere between 16 and 32), to a much larger set of physical registers (hundreds). Because name dependencies (WAW/WAR) are removed, ILP is improved compared to scoarboarding.

An example of register renaming:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1) AR_1=10
(2) AR_2=AR_1 ;; RAW
(3) AR_2=20   ;; WAW
(4) AR_1=30   ;; WAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
after register renaming:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1) PR_35=10
(2) PR_36=PR_35 ;; RAW
(2) PR_37=20
(3) PR_38=30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the above example, only the RAW dependency (2) is preserved. All the instruction can be performed in any other, apart from (1) and (2) because the RAW needs to be preserved. So the stores can be performed out of order, but remember that instructions will retire in order and therefor the architectural state will become visible in order and therefor he the effects of the out of order execution are not visible to the outside.

A data dependency chain is when you have a chain of RAW dependencies, e.g.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1) AR_1=10
(2) AR_2=AR_1 ;; RAW
(3) AR_3=AR_2 ;; RAW
(4) AR_4=AR_3 ;; RAW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are problematic for OOoE because there no increase in ILP after register renaming because all the RAW dependencies are preserved:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1) PR_35=10
(2) PR_36=AR_35 ;; RAW
(3) PR_37=AR_36 ;; RAW
(4) PR_38=AR_37 ;; RAW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When there are multiple independent data dependency chains, then there is still a chance that the CPU can find ILP.

Most implementations strive to balance the hardware cost with the potential return. Typically, the size of the reorder buffer determines how far ahead the hardware can look for scheduling such independent instructions. With the introduction of the Apple M1, the reorder buffer size almost doubled compared to the fastest X86 implementations and Apple showed there is a lot of potential to uncover more parallel instructions inside a singe instruction stream.

![The concept of out-of-order execution.](../../img/uarch/OOO.png){#fig:OOO width=80%}

Figure @fig:OOO details the concept underlying out-of-order execution with an example. Assume instruction x+1 cannot execute in cycles 4 and 5 due to a conflict. An in-order CPU would stall all subsequent instructions from entering the EXE pipeline stage. In a CPU with OOO execution, a subsequent instruction that does not have any conflicts (e.g., instruction `x+2`) can enter and complete its execution. All instructions still retire in order, i.e., the instructions complete the WB stage in the program order.

### Superscalar Engines

Most modern CPUs are superscalar i.e., they can issue more than one instruction in a given cycle. Issue-width is the maximum number of instructions that can be issued during the same cycle. Typical issue-width of current generation CPUs ranges from 2 to 6. To ensure the right balance, such superscalar engines also have more than one execution unit and/or pipelined execution units. CPUs also combine superscalar capability with deep pipelines and out-of-order execution to extract the maximum ILP for a given piece of software. 

![The pipeline diagram for a simple 2-way superscalar CPU.](../../img/uarch/SuperScalar.png){#fig:SuperScalar width=55%}

Figure @fig:SuperScalar shows an example CPU that supports 2-wide issue width, i.e., in each cycle, two instructions are processed in each stage of the pipeline. Superscalar CPUs typically support multiple, independent execution units to keep the instructions in the pipeline flowing through without conflicts. In addition to pipelining, replicating execution units further increases the performance of a machine.

### Speculative Execution {#sec:SpeculativeExec}

As noted in the previous section, control hazards can cause significant performance loss in a pipeline if instructions are stalled until the branch condition is resolved. One technique to avoid this performance loss is hardware branch prediction logic to predict the likely direction of branches and allow executing instructions from the predicted path (speculative execution).

Let's consider the short code example in @lst:Speculative. For a processor to understand which function it should execute next, it should know whether the condition `a < b` is false or true. Without knowing that, the CPU waits until the result of the branch instruction will be determined, as shown in Figure @fig:NoSpeculation. 

Listing: Speculative execution

if (a < b)
  foo();
else
  bar();

The concept of speculative execution.
</div>

With speculative execution, the CPU takes a guess on an outcome of the branch and initiates processing instructions from the chosen path. Suppose a processor predicted that condition `a < b` will be evaluated as true. It proceeded without waiting for the branch outcome and speculatively called function `foo` (see Figure @fig:SpeculativeExec, speculative work is marked with `*`). State changes to the machine cannot be committed until the condition is resolved to ensure that the architectural state of the machine is never impacted by speculatively executing instructions. In the example above, the branch instruction compares two scalar values, which is fast. But in reality, a branch instruction can be dependent on a value loaded from memory, which can take hundreds of cycles. If the prediction turns out to be correct, it saves a lot of cycles. However, sometimes the prediction is incorrect, and the function `bar` should be called instead. In such a case, the results from the speculative execution must be squashed and thrown away. This is called the branch misprediction penalty, which we will discuss in [@sec:BbMisp].


The ROB keeps track of the state of each instruction and when there is a speculation failure, the it is easy to rollback.

The ROB maintains the status of all instruction execution and retires instructions in-order. Results from speculative execution are written to the ROB and are committed to the architecture registers, in the same order as the program order and only if the speculation is correct. 

It isn't only branches which the CPU can speculate on. Another example is speculating on violations of the memory orde. On the X86, due to OOoE, loads can be performed out of order. But if such a reordering would become visible, the core will detect this and nuke the pipeline and restart.


### Branch Prediction

As we just have seen, correct predictions greatly improve execution as they allow a CPU to make forward progress without having results of previous instructions available. However, bad speculation often incurs costly performance penalties. Modern CPUs employ sophisticated dynamic branch prediction mechanisms that provide very high accuracy and can adapt to dynamic changes in branch behavior. There are three types of branches which could be handled in a special way:

* **Unconditional jumps and direct calls**: they are the easiest to predict as they are always taken and go in the same direction every time.
* **Conditional branches**: they have two potential outcomes: taken or not taken. Taken branches can go forward or backward. Forward conditional branches are usually generated for `if-else` statements, which have a high chance of not being taken, as frequently it represents error-checking code. Backward conditional jumps are frequently seen in loops and are used to go to the next iteration of a loop; such branches are usually taken.
* **Indirect calls and jumps**: they have many targets. An indirect jump or indirect call can be generated for a `switch` statement, a function pointer, or a `virtual` function. A return from a function deserves attention because it has many potential targets as well.

Most prediction algorithms are based on previous outcomes of the branch. The core of the branch prediction unit (BPU) is a branch target buffer (BTB), which caches the target addresses for every branch. Prediction algorithms consult the BTB every cycle to generate the next address from which to fetch instructions. The CPU uses that new address to fetch the next block of instructions. If no branches are identified in the current fetch block, the next address to fetch will be the next sequential aligned fetch block (fall through). 

Unconditional branches do not require prediction; we just need to lookup the target address in the BTB. Remember, every cycle the BPU needs to generate the next address from which to fetch instructions to avoid pipeline stalls. We could have extracted the address just from the instruction encoding itself, but then we have to wait until the decode stage is over, which will introduce a bubble in the pipeline and make things slower. So, the next fetch address has to be determined at the time when the branch is fetched. 

For conditional branches, we first need to predict whether the branch will be taken or not. If it is not taken, then we fall through and there is no need to lookup the target. Otherwise, we lookup the target address in the BTB. Conditional branches usually account for the biggest portion of total branches and are the main source of misprediction penalties in production software. For indirect branches we need to select one of the possible targets, but the prediction algorithm can be very similar to conditional branches.

All prediction mechanisms try to exploit two important principles, which are similar to what we will discuss with caches later:

* **Temporal correlation**: the way a branch resolves may be a good predictor of the way it will resolve at the next execution. This is also know as local correlation.
* **Spatial correlation**: several adjacent branches may resolve in a highly correlated manner (a preferred path of execution). This is also know as global correlation.

The best accuracy is often achieved by leveraging local and global correlation together. So, not only do we look at the outcome history of the current branch, we also correlate it with the outcomes of other branches. 

Another common technique used is called hybrid prediction. The idea is that some branches have biased behavior. For example, if a conditional branch goes in one direction 99.9% of the time, there is no need to use a complex predictor and pollute its data structures. A much simpler machanism can be used instead. Another example is a loop branch. If a branch has loop behavior, then it can be predicted using a dedicated loop predictor, which will remember the number of iterations the loop typically executes.

Today, state of the art prediction is dominated by TAGE-like [@Seznec2006] or perceptron-based [@Jimenez2001] predictors. Championship[^6] branch predictors make less than 3 mispredictions per 1000 instructions. Modern CPUs routinely reach >95% prediction rate on most workloads.
