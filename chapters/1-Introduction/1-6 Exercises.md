## Exercises

As a supplemental material for this book, we developed Performance Ninja, a free online course where you can practice low-level performance analysis and tuning. It is available at the following URL: [https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-ninja](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-ninja). It has a collection of lab assignments that focus on a specific performance problem. Each lab assignment can take anywhere from 30 mins up to 4 hours depending on your background and the complexity of the lab assignment itself.

Following the name of the GitHub repository, we will use `perf-ninja` to refer to the online course. In the "Questions and Exercises" section at the end of each chapter, you may find assignments from `perf-ninja`. For example, when you see `perf-ninja::warmup`, this corresponds to the lab assignment that is located in `labs/misc/warmup` folder in the aforementioned repository. We encourage you to solve these puzzles to solidify your knowledge.

You can solve assignments on your local machine or submit your code changes to GitHub for automated verification and benchmarking. If you choose the latter, follow the instructions on the "Get Started" page of the repo. We also use examples from `perf-ninja` throughout the book. This enables you to reproduce a specific performance problem on your own machine and experiment with it.
