## What Is Performance Tuning?

Locating a performance bottleneck is only half of an engineerâ€™s job. The second half is to fix it properly. Sometimes changing one line in the source code of a program can yield a drastic performance boost. Missing such opportunities can be quite wasteful. Performance analysis and tuning are all about finding and fixing this line.

To take advantage of all the computing power of modern CPUs, you need to understand how they work. Or as performance engineers like to say, you need to have "mechanical sympathy". This term was borrowed from the car racing world. It means that a racing driver with a good understanding of how the car works has an edge over its competitors who don't. The same applies to performance engineering. It is not possible to know all the details of how a modern CPU operates, but you need to have a good mental model of it to squeeze the last bit of performance.

This is what I mean by "low-level optimizations". This is a type of optimization that takes into account the details of the underlying hardware capabilities. It is different from "high-level optimizations" which are more about application-level logic, algorithms, and data structures. As you will see in the book, the majority of low-level optimizations can be applied to a wide variety of modern processors. To successfully implement low-level optimizations, you need to have a good understanding of the underlying hardware.

In the past, software developers had more mechanical sympathy, as they often had to deal with nuances of the hardware implementation. During the PC era, developers usually were programming directly on top of the operating system, with possibly a few libraries in between. As the world moved to the cloud era, the software stack grew deeper, broader, and more complex. The top layer of the stack (on which most developers work) has moved further away from the hardware. The negative side of such evolution is that developers of modern applications have less affinity for the actual hardware on which their software is running. This book will help you build a strong connection with modern processors.

There is a famous quote by Donald Knuth: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil". But the opposite is often true as well. Postponed performance engineering may be too late and cause as much evil as premature optimization. For developers working with performance-critical projects, it is crucial to know how underlying hardware works. In such roles, program development without a hardware focus is a failure from the beginning. Performance characteristics of software must be a primary objective alongside correctness and security from day 1. Poor performance can kill a product just as easily as security vulnerabilities.

Performance engineering is important and rewarding work, but it may be very time-consuming. In fact, performance optimization is a game with no end. There will always be something to optimize. Inevitably, a developer will reach the point of diminishing returns at which further improvement is not justified by expected engineering costs. Knowing when to stop optimizing is a critical aspect of performance work.
