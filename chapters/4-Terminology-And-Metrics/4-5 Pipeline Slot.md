## Pipeline Slot {#sec:PipelineSlot}

Another important metric which some performance tools use is the concept of a *pipeline slot*. A pipeline slot represents hardware resources needed to process one uop. Figure @fig:PipelineSlot demonstrates the execution pipeline of a CPU that has 4 allocation slots every cycle. That means that the core can assign execution resources (renamed source and destination registers, execution port, ROB entries, etc.) to 4 new uops every cycle. Such a processor is usually called a *4-wide machine*. During six consecutive cycles on the diagram, only half of the available slots were utilized. From a microarchitecture perspective, the efficiency of executing such code is only 50%.

Intel's Skylake and AMD Zen3 cores have 4-wide allocation. Intel's SunnyCove microarchitecure was a 5-wide design. As of 2023, most recent Goldencove and Zen4 architectures both have 6-wide allocation. Apple M1 design is not officially disclosed but is measured to be 8-wide.[^1]

Pipeline slot is one of the core metrics in Top-down Microarchitecture Analysis (see [@sec:TMA]). For example, Front-End Bound and Back-End Bound metrics are expressed as a percentage of unutilized Pipeline Slots due to various reasons.
