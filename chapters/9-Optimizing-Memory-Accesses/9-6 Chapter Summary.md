## Chapter Summary {.unlisted .unnumbered}

* Most of the real-world applications experience performance bottlenecks that can be related to the CPU Backend. It is not surprising since all the memory-related issues, as well as inefficient computations, belong to this category.
* Performance of the memory subsystem is not growing as fast as CPU performance. Yet, memory accesses are a frequent source of performance problems in many applications. Speeding up such programs requires revising the way they access memory.
* In [@sec:MemBound], we discussed some of the popular recipes for cache-friendly data structures, memory prefetching, and utilizing large memory pages to improve DTLB performance.
