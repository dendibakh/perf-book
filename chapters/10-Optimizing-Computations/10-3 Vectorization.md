## Vectorization {#sec:Vectorization}

On modern processors, the use of SIMD instructions can result in a great speedup over regular un-vectorized (scalar) code. When doing performance analysis, one of the top priorities of the software engineer is to ensure that the hot parts of the code are vectorized by the compiler. This section is supposed to guide engineers towards discovering vectorization opportunities. To recap on general information about the SIMD capabilities of modern CPUs, readers can take a look at [@sec:SIMD].

Most vectorization happens automatically without any intervention of the user (Autovectorization). That is when a compiler automatically recognizes the opportunity to produce SIMD machine code from the source code. It is a good strategy to rely on autovectorization since modern compilers generate fast vectorized code for a wide variety of source code inputs. Echoing advice given earlier, the author recommends to let the compiler do its job and only interfere when it is needed.

In rather rare cases, software engineers need to adjust autovectorization, based on the feedback[^2] that they get from a compiler or profiling data. In such cases, programmers need to tell the compiler that some code region is vectorizable or that vectorization is profitable. Modern compilers have extensions that allow power users to control the vectorizer directly and make sure that certain parts of the code are vectorized efficiently. There will be several examples of using compiler hints in the subsequent sections.

It is important to note that there is a range of problems where SIMD is invaluable and where autovectorization just does not work and is not likely to work in the near future (one can find an example in [@Mula_Lemire_2019]). If it is not possible to make a compiler generate desired assembly instructions, a code snippet can be rewritten with the help of compiler intrinsics. In most cases, compiler intrinsics provide a 1-to-1 mapping into assembly instruction (see [@sec:secIntrinsics]).

\personalOpinion{Even though in some cases developers need to mess around with compiler intrinsics, I recommend to mostly rely on compiler auto-vectorization and only use intrinsics when necessary. A code that uses compiler intrinsics resembles inline assembly and quickly becomes unreadable. Compiler auto-vectorization can often be adjusted using pragmas and other hints.}

Generally, three kinds of vectorization are done in a compiler: inner loop vectorization, outer loop vectorization, and SLP (Superword-Level Parallelism) vectorization. In this section, we will mostly consider inner loop vectorization since this is the most common case. We provide general information about the outer loop and SLP vectorization in appendix B.

### Compiler Autovectorization.

Multiple hurdles can prevent auto-vectorization, some of which are inherent to the semantics of programming languages. For example, the compiler must assume that unsigned loop-indices may overflow, and this can prevent certain loop transformations. Another example is the assumption that the C programming language makes: pointers in the program may point to overlapping memory regions, which can make the analysis of the program very difficult. Another major hurdle is the design of the processor itself. In some cases processors, don’t have efficient vector instructions for certain operations. For example, performing predicated (bitmask-controlled) load and store operations are not available on most processors. Another example is vector-wide format conversion between signed integers to doubles because the result operates on vector registers of different sizes. Despite all of the challenges, the software developer can work around many of the challenges and enable vectorization. Later in the section, we provide guidance on how to work with the compiler and ensure that the hot code is vectorized by the compiler.


The vectorizer is usually structured in three phases: legality-check, profitability-check, and transformation itself:

* **Legality-check**. In this phase, the compiler checks if it is legal to transform the loop (or some other code region) into using vectors. The loop vectorizer checks that the iterations of the loop are consecutive, which means that the loop progresses linearly. The vectorizer also ensures that all of the memory and arithmetic operations in the loop can be widened into consecutive operations. That the control flow of the loop is uniform across all lanes and that the memory access patterns are uniform. The compiler has to check or ensure somehow that the generated code won’t touch memory that it is not supposed to and that the order of operations will be preserved. The compiler needs to analyze the possible range of pointers, and if it has some missing information, it has to assume that the transformation is illegal. The legality phase collects a list of requirements that need to happen for vectorization of the loop to be legal.
* **Profitability-check**. Next, the vectorizer checks if a transformation is profitable. It compares different vectorization factors and figures out which vectorization factor would be the fastest to execute. The vectorizer uses a cost model to predict the cost of different operations, such as scalar add or vector load. It needs to take into account the added instructions that shuffle data into registers, predict register pressure, and estimate the cost of the loop guards that ensure that preconditions that allow vectorizations are met. The algorithm for checking profitability is simple: 1) add-up the cost of all of the operations in the code, 2) compare the costs of each version of the code, 3) divide the cost by the expected execution count. For example, if the scalar code costs 8 cycles, and the vectorized code costs 12 cycles, but performs 4 loop iterations at once, then the vectorized version of the loop is probably faster.

* **Transformation**. Finally, after the vectorizer figures out that the transformation is legal and profitable, it transforms the code. This process also includes the insertion of guards that enable vectorization. For example, most loops use an unknown iteration count, so the compiler has to generate a scalar version of the loop, in addition to the vectorized version of the loop, to handle the last few iterations. The compiler also has to check if pointers don’t overlap, etc. All of these transformations are done using information that is collected during the legality check phase.

### Discovering vectorization opportunities.

[Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law)[^6] teaches us that we should spend time analyzing only those parts of code that are used the most during the execution of a program. Thus, the performance engineer should focus on hot parts of the code that were highlighted by a profiling tool (see [@sec:profiling]). As mentioned earlier, vectorization is most frequently applied to loops.

Discovering opportunities for improving vectorization should start by analyzing hot loops in the program and checking what optimizations were performed by the compiler to them. Checking compiler vectorization remarks (see [@sec:compilerOptReports]) is the easiest way to know that. Modern compilers can report whether a certain loop was vectorized, provide additional details, like vectorization factor (VF). In the case when the compiler cannot vectorize a loop, it is also able to tell the reason why it failed. 

An alternative way to using compiler optimization reports is to check assembly output. It is best to analyze the output from a profiling tool that shows the correspondence between the source code and generated assembly instructions for a given loop. However, this method requires the ability to read and understand assembly language. It may take some time to figure out the semantics of the instructions generated by the compiler[^3]. But this skill is highly rewarding and often provide additional insights. For example, one can spot suboptimal generated code, such as lack of vectorization, suboptimal vectorization factor, performing unnecessary computations, etc.

There are a few common cases that developers frequently run into when trying to accelerate vectorizable code. Below we present four typical scenarios and give general guidance on how to proceed in each case.

### Vectorization is illegal.

In some cases, the code that iterates over elements of an array is simply not vectorizable. Vectorization remarks are very effective at explaining what went wrong and why the compiler can’t vectorize the code. [@lst:VectDep] shows an example of dependence inside a loop that prevents vectorization[^31].

Listing: Vectorization: read-after-write dependence.

~~~~ {#lst:VectDep .cpp}
void vectorDependence(int *A, int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    A[i] = A[i-1] * 2;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While some loops cannot be vectorized due to the hard limitations described above, others could be vectorized when certain constraints are relaxed. There are situations when the compiler cannot vectorize a loop because it simply cannot prove it is legal to do so. Compilers are generally very conservative and only do transformations when they are sure it doesn't break the code. Such soft limitations could be relaxed by providing additional hints to the compiler. For example, when transforming the code that performs floating-point arithmetic, vectorization may change the behavior of the program. The floating-point addition and multiplication are commutative, which means that you can swap the left-hand side and the right-hand side without changing the result: `(a + b == b + a)`. However, these operations are not associative, because rounding happens at different times: `((a + b) + c) != (a + (b + c))`. The code in [@lst:VectIllegal] cannot be auto vectorized by the compiler. The reason is that vectorization would change the variable sum into a vector accumulator, and this will change the order of operations and may lead to different rounding decisions and a different result. 

Listing: Vectorization: floating-point arithmetic.

~~~~ {#lst:VectIllegal .cpp .numberLines}
// a.cpp
float calcSum(float* a, unsigned N) {
  float sum = 0.0f;
  for (unsigned i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    sum += a[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

However, if the program can tolerate a bit of inaccuracy in the final result (which usually is the case), we can convey this information to the compiler to enable vectorization. Clang and GCC compilers have a flag, `-ffast-math`[^29],  that allows this kind of transformation:

```bash
$ clang++ -c a.cpp -O3 -march=core-avx2 -Rpass-analysis=.*
...
a.cpp:5:9: remark: loop not vectorized: cannot prove it is safe to reorder floating-point operations; allow reordering by specifying '#pragma clang loop vectorize(enable)' before the loop or by providing the compiler option '-ffast-math'. [-Rpass-analysis=loop-vectorize]
...
$ clang++ -c a.cpp -O3 -ffast-math -Rpass=.*
...
a.cpp:4:3: remark: vectorized loop (vectorization width: 4, interleaved count: 2) [-Rpass=loop-vectorize]
...
```

Let's look at another typical situation when a compiler may need support from a developer to perform vectorization. When compilers cannot prove that a loop operates on arrays with non-overlapping memory regions, they usually choose to be on the safe side. Let's revisit the example from [@lst:optReport] provided in [@sec:compilerOptReports]. When the compiler tries to vectorize the code presented in [@lst:OverlappingMemRefions], it generally cannot do this because the memory regions of arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` can overlap.

Listing: a.c

~~~~ {#lst:OverlappingMemRefions .cpp .numberLines}
void foo(float* a, float* b, float* c, unsigned N) {
  for (unsigned i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    c[i] = b[i];
    a[i] = c[i-1];
  }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the optimization report (enabled with `-fopt-info`) provided by GCC 10.2:

```bash
$ gcc -O3 -march=core-avx2 -fopt-info
a.cpp:2:26: optimized: loop vectorized using 32 byte vectors
a.cpp:2:26: optimized:  loop versioned for vectorization because of possible aliasing
```

GCC has recognized potential overlap between memory regions of arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`, and created multiple versions of the same loop. The compiler inserted runtime checks[^36] for detecting if the memory regions overlap. Based on that checks, it dispatches between vectorized and scalar[^35] versions. In this case, vectorization comes with the cost of inserting potentially expensive runtime checks. If a developer knows that memory regions of arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` do not overlap, it can insert `#pragma GCC ivdep`[^37] right before the loop or use the `__restrict__  ` keyword as shown in [@lst:optReport2]. Such compiler hints will eliminate the need for the GCC compiler to insert runtime checks mentioned earlier.

By their nature, compilers are static tools: they only reason based on the code they work with. For example, some of the dynamic tools, such as Intel Advisor, can detect if issues like cross-iteration dependence or access to arrays with overlapping memory regions actually occur in a given loop. But be aware that such tools only provide a suggestion. Carelessly inserting compiler hints can cause real problems.

### Vectorization is not beneficial.

In some cases, the compiler can vectorize the loop but figures that doing so is not profitable. In the code presented on [@lst:VectNotProfit], the compiler could vectorize the memory access to array `A` but would need to split the access to array `B` into multiple scalar loads. The scatter/gather pattern is relatively expensive, and compilers that can simulate the cost of operations often decide to avoid vectorizing code with such patterns. 

Listing: Vectorization: not beneficial.

~~~~ {#lst:VectNotProfit .cpp .numberLines}
// a.cpp
void stridedLoads(int *A, int *B, int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    A[i] += B[i * 3];
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the compiler optimization report for the code in [@lst:VectNotProfit]: 

```bash
$ clang -c -O3 -march=core-avx2 a.cpp -Rpass-missed=loop-vectorize
a.cpp:3:3: remark: the cost-model indicates that vectorization is not beneficial [-Rpass-missed=loop-vectorize]
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  ^
```

Users can force the Clang compiler to vectorize the loop by using the `#pragma` hint, as shown in [@lst:VectNotProfitOverriden]. However, keep in mind that the true fact of whether vectorization is profitable or not largely depends on the runtime data, for example, the number of iterations of the loop. Compilers don't have this information available[^1], so they often tend to be conservative. Developers can use such hints when searching for performance headrooms.

Listing: Vectorization: not beneficial.

~~~~ {#lst:VectNotProfitOverriden .cpp .numberLines}
// a.cpp
void stridedLoads(int *A, int *B, int n) {
#pragma clang loop vectorize(enable)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    A[i] += B[i * 3];
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developers should be aware of the hidden cost of using vectorized code. Using AVX and especially AVX512 vector instructions would lead to a big frequency downclocking. The vectorized portion of the code should be hot enough to justify using AVX512.[^38]

### Loop vectorized but scalar version used.

In some cases, the compiler can successfully vectorize the code, but the vectorized code does not show in the profiler. When inspecting the corresponding assembly of a loop, it is usually easy to find the vectorized version of the loop body because it uses the vector registers, which are not commonly used in other parts of the program, and the code is unrolled and filled with checks and multiple versions for enabling different edge cases. 

If the generated code is not executed, one possible reason for this is that the code that the compiler has generated assumes loop trip counts that are higher than what the program uses. For example, to vectorize efficiently on a modern CPU, programmers need to vectorize and utilize AVX2 and also unroll the loop 4-5 times in order to generate enough work for the pipelined FMA units. This means that each loop iteration needs to process around 40 elements. Many loops may run with loop trip counts that are below this value and may fall back to use the scalar remainder loop. It is easy to detect these cases because the scalar remainder loop would light up in the profiler, and the vectorized code would remain cold. 

The solution to this problem is to force the vectorizer to use a lower vectorization factor or unroll count, to reduce the number of elements that loops process and enable more loops with lower trip counts to visit the fast vectorized loop body. Developers can achieve that with the help of `#pragma` hints. For Clang compiler one can use `#pragma clang loop vectorize_width(N)` as shown in the [article](https://easyperf.net/blog/2017/11/09/Multiversioning_by_trip_counts)[^30]on easyperf  blog.

### Loop vectorized in a suboptimal way.

When you see a loop being vectorized and is executed at runtime, likely this part of the program already performs well. However, there are exceptions. Sometimes human experts can come up with the code that outperforms the one generated by the compiler. 

The optimal vectorization factor can be unintuitive because of several factors. First, it is difficult for humans to simulate the operations of the CPU in their heads, and there is no alternative to actually trying multiple configurations. Vector shuffles that touch multiple vector lanes could be more or less expensive than expected, depending on many factors. Second, at runtime, the program may behave in unpredictable ways, depending on port pressure and many other factors. The advice here is to try to force the vectorizer to pick one specific vectorization factor and unroll factor and measure the result. Vectorization pragmas can help the user enumerate different vectorization factors and figure out the most performant one. There are relatively few possible configurations for each loop, and running the loop on typical inputs is something that humans can do that compilers can’t.

Finally, there are situations when the scalar un-vectorized version of a loop performs better than the vectorized one. This could happen due to expensive vector operations like `gather/scatter` loads, masking, shuffles, etc. which compiler is required to use in order to make vectorization happen. Performance engineers could also try to disable vectorization in different ways. For the Clang compiler, it can be done via compiler options `-fno-vectorize` and `-fno-slp-vectorize`, or with a hint specific for a particular loop, e.g. `#pragma clang loop vectorize(enable)`.

### Use languages with explicit vectorization. {#sec:ISPC}

Vectorization can also be achieved by rewriting parts of a program in a programming language that is dedicated to parallel computing. Those languages use special constructs and knowledge of the program's data to compile the code efficiently into parallel programs. Originally such languages were mainly used to offload work to specific processing units such as graphics processing units (GPU), digital signal processors (DSP), or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, some of those programming models can also target your CPU (such as OpenCL and OpenMP).

One such parallel language is Intel® Implicit SPMD Program Compiler [(ISPC)](https://ispc.github.io/)[^33], which we will cover a bit in this section. The ISPC language is based on the C programming language and uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure to emit optimized code for many different architectures. The key feature of ISPC is the "close to the metal" programming model and performance portability across SIMD architectures. It requires a shift from the traditional thinking of writing programs but gives programmers more control over CPU resource utilization.

Another advantage of ISPC is its interoperability and ease of use. ISPC compiler generates standard object files that can be linked with the code generated by conventional C/C++ compilers. ISPC code can be easily plugged in any native project since functions written with ISPC can be called as if it was C code.

[@lst:ISPC_code] shows a simple example of a function that we presented earlier in [@lst:VectIllegal], rewritten with ISPC. ISPC considers that the program will run in parallel instances, based on the target instruction set. For example, when using SSE with `float`s, it can compute 4 operations in parallel. Each program instance would operate on vector values of `i` being `(0,1,2,3)`, then `(4,5,6,7)`, and so on, effectively computing 4 sums at a time. As you can see, a few keywords not typical for C and C++ are used:

* The `export` keyword means that the function can be called from a C-compatible language.

* The `uniform` keyword means that a variable is shared between program instances.

* The `varying` keyword means that each program instance has its own local copy of the variable.

* The `foreach` is the same as a classic `for` loop except that it will distribute the work across the different program instances. 

Listing: ISPC version of summing elements of an array.

~~~~ {#lst:ISPC_code .cpp}
export uniform float calcSum(const uniform float array[], 
                             uniform ptrdiff_t count)
{
    varying float sum = 0;
    foreach (i = 0 ... count)
        sum += array[i];
    return reduce_add(sum);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since function `calcSum` must return a single value (a `uniform` variable) and our `sum` variable is a `varying`, we then need to *gather* the values of each program instance using the `reduce_add` function. ISPC also takes care of generating peeled and remainder loops as needed to take into account the data that is not correctly aligned or that is not a multiple of the vector width. 

**"Close to the metal" programming model**. One of the problems with traditional C and C++ languages is that compiler doesn't always vectorize critical parts of code. Often times programmers resort to using compiler intrinsics (see [@sec:secIntrinsics]), which bypasses compiler autovectorization but is generally difficult and requires updating when new instruction sets come along. ISPC helps to resolve this problem by assuming every operation is SIMD by default. For example, the ISPC statement `sum += array[i]` is implicitly considered as a SIMD operation that makes multiple additions in parallel. ISPC is not an autovectorizing compiler, and it does not automatically discover vectorization opportunities. Since the ISPC language is very similar to C and C++, it is much better than using intrinsics as it allows you to focus on the algorithm rather than the low-level instructions. Also, it has reportedly matched[@ISPC_Paper] or beaten[^34] hand-written intrinsics code in terms of performance.

**Performance portability**. ISPC can automatically detect features of your CPU to fully utilize all the resources available. Programmers can write ISPC code once and compile to many vector instruction sets, such as SSE4, AVX, and AVX2. ISPC can also emit code for different architectures like x86 CPU, ARM NEON, and has experimental support for GPU offloading.
