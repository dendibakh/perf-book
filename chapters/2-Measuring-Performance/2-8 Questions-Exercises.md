\markright{Questions and Exercises}

1. Is it always safe to take a mean of a series of measurements to determine the running time of a program? What are the pitfalls?
2. Suppose you've identified a performance bug that you're now trying to fix in your development environment. How would you reduce the noise in the system to have more pronounced benchmarking results?
3. Is it OK to track the overall performance of a program with function-level unit tests?
4. Does your organization have a performance regression system in place? If yes, can it be improved? If not, think about the strategy of installing one. Take into consideration: what is changing and what isn't (source code, compiler, hardware configuration, etc.), how often a change occurs, what is the measurement variance, what is the running time of the benchmark suite and how many iterations you can run.
