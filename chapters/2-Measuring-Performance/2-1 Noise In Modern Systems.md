## Noise in Modern Systems {#sec:secFairExperiments}

There are many features in hardware and software that are designed to increase performance, but not all of them have deterministic behavior. Let's consider Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DFS), a feature that allows a CPU to increase its frequency far above the base frequency, allowing it to run significantly faster. DFS is also frequently referred to as *turbo* mode. Unfortunately, a CPU cannot stay in the turbo mode for a long time, otherwise it may face the risk of overheating. So later, it decreases its frequency to stay within its thermal limits. DFS usually depends a lot on the current system load and external factors, such as core temperature, which makes it hard to predict the impact on performance measurements.

Figure @fig:FreqScaling shows a typical example where DFS can cause variance in performance. In our scenario, we started two runs of a benchmark, one right after another on a "cold" processor.[^1] During the first second, the first iteration of the benchmark was running on the maximum turbo frequency of 4.4 GHz but later the CPU had to decrease its frequency below 4 GHz. The second run did not have the advantage of boosting the CPU frequency and did not enter the turbo mode. Even though we ran the exact same version of the benchmark two times, the environment in which they ran was not the same. As you can see, the first run is 200 milliseconds faster than the second run due to the fact that it was running with a higher CPU frequency in the beginning. Such a scenario can frequently happen when you benchmark software on a laptop since laptops have limited heat dissipation.[^4]

Frequency Scaling is an example of how a hardware feature can cause variations in our measurements, however, they could also come from software. Let's consider benchmarking a `git status` command, which accesses many files on the disk. The filesystem plays a big role for performance in this scenario; in particular, the filesystem cache. On the first run, the required entries in the filesystem cache are missing. The filesystem cache is not effective and our `git status` command runs very slowly. However, the second time, the filesystem cache will be warmed up, making it much faster than the first run.

You're probably thinking about including a dry run before taking measurements. That certainly helps, unfortunately, measurement bias can persist through the runs as well. [@Mytkowicz09] paper demonstrates that UNIX environment size (i.e., the total number of bytes required to store the environment variables) or the link order (the order of object files that are given to the linker) can affect performance in unpredictable ways. There are numerous other ways how memory layout may affect performance measurements.[^2]

Having consistent performance requires running all iterations of the benchmark with the same conditions. It is impossible to achieve 100% consistent results on every run of a benchmark, but perhaps you can get close by carefully controlling the environment. Eliminating nondeterminism in a system is helpful for well-defined, stable performance tests, e.g., microbenchmarks. 

Consider a situation when you implemented a code change and want to know the relative speedup ratio by benchmarking the "before" and "after" versions of the program. This is a scenario in which you can control most of the variability in a system, including HW configuration, OS settings, background processes, etc. Disabling features with nondeterministic performance impact will help you get a more consistent and accurate comparison. You can find examples of such features and how to disable them in Appendix A. Also, there are tools that can set up the environment to ensure benchmarking results with a low variance; one such tool is [temci](https://github.com/parttimenerd/temci)[^14].

However, it is not possible to replicate the exact same environment and eliminate bias completely: there could be different temperature conditions, power delivery spikes, unexpected system interrupts, etc. Chasing all potential sources of noise and variation in a system can be a never-ending story. Sometimes it cannot be achieved, for example, when you're benchmarking a large distributed cloud service.

You should not eliminate system nondeterministic behavior when you want to measure the real-world performance impact of your change. Users of your application are likely to have all the features enabled since these features provide better performance. Yes, these features may contribute to performance instabilities, but they are designed to improve the overall performance of the system. In fact, your customers probably do not care about nondeterministic performance as long as it helps to run as fast as possible. So, when you analyze the performance of a production application, you should try to replicate the target system configuration, which you are optimizing for. Introducing any artificial tuning to the system will change results from what users of your service will see in practice.[^3]

[^1]: By cold processor, we mean the CPU that stayed in idle mode for a while, allowing it to cool down its temperature. 
[^2]: One approach to enable statistically sound performance analysis was presented in [@Curtsinger13]. This work showed that it's possible to eliminate measurement bias that comes from memory layout by repeatedly randomizing the placement of code, stack, and heap objects at runtime. Sadly, these ideas didn't go much further, and right now, this project is almost abandoned.
[^3]: Another downside of disabling nondeterministic performance features is that it makes a benchmark run longer. This is especially important for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) performance testing when there are time limits for how long it should take to run the whole benchmark suite.
[^4]: Remember that even running Windows task manager or Linux `top` programs, can affect measurements since an additional CPU core will be activated and assigned to it. This might affect the frequency of the core that is running the actual benchmark.
