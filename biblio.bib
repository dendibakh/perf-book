  abstract      = {As software becomes larger, programming languages become higher-level, and processors continue to fail to be clocked faster, we'll increasingly require compilers to reduce code bloat, eliminate abstraction penalties, and exploit interesting instruction sets. At the same time, compiler execution time must not increase too much and also compilers should never produce the wrong output. This paper examines the problem of making optimizing compilers faster, less buggy, and more capable of generating high-quality output.},

We construct a model that explains how these strongly nonideal statistics can arise from environmental fluctuations, and also justifies our proposed strategy. We implement this strategy in the BenchmarkTools Julia package, where it is used in production continuous integration (CI) pipelines for developing the Julia language and its ecosystem.},
